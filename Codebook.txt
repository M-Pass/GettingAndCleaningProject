Original Experiment Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an 
age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, 
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer 
and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular 
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded 
to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned 
into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the 
training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying 
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 
50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth 
low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is 
assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz 
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained 
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Summary Dataset Description: 

The summary dataset obtained after running run_analysis.R (which outputs 
results.txt) contains six columns: 
- Subject: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
- Activity: The type of activity performed
- Sensor: The type of sensor measurement (see Sensor Informations section for 
details)
- Statistic: The statistic run to summarize THE ORIGINAL TIME-SERIES data 
(either mean or std - see "UCI HAR DATASET/features_info.txt for details)
- Dimension: The spatial dimension considered, when applicable (either X, Y or 
Z, or missing for measures with no specific spatial dimension - see Sensor 
Information for details)
- Value: The AVERAGE MEASUREMENT OBTAINED for the descriptive statistic 
Statistic, for each combination of subject, activity performed, sensor 
measurement, and spatial dimension. 

Sensor Information:
The features selected for the original database come from the accelerometer and 
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then 
they 
were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration 
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in 
time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the 
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the 
Euclidean 
norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 
tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals 
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, 
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain 
signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each 
pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

NOTE: in the summary dataset obtained from run_analysis.R information on 
spatial dimension is coded in a separate variable. This variable (Dimension) has 
value X, Y or Z for measurements which considered the three spatial dimensions 
and has a 
missing value for measurements with no spatial dimension information (all the
magnitude measurements)
